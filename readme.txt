	This is Demonstration of Abstract Factory Method Pattern 


	interface	Color								Travel

	abstract class		AbstractFactory		return Color / Travel

	class	      AbstractColor	    AbstractTravel	
			
			return			raturn
			Color			Travel



	
1) methods of class FactoryProducer returns obj of class AbstractFactory when user calls static methods of AbstarctFactory .

2) By calling methods of of AbstarctFactory class on its object got from step(1) cretes object of Color/Travel.
